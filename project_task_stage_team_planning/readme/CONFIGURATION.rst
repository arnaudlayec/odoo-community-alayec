
From the menu *Projects / Configuration / Task Stages* (requiring activated developer
mode to be seen), you may create, modify, delete any *Task Stages*.
Since per-project organization of *Task Stages* is disabled, any *Task Stage* created
here will be common to all users and projects.

Note: if the Stage *Internal* appears in *My Tasks*, this is because *HR Timesheet*
module install it by default. You may change the sequence of the *Internal* stage
to a higher sequence and folded from *Project / Configuration / Task Stages*, or change
the configuration in *General Settings / Timesheets / Time Off* to switch it to another
task and archive or delete it.
