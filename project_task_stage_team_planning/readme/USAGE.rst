
#. Create a project, several tasks in it affected to different users
#. Browse to the menu *Project / My Tasks*
#. Move the cards (tasks) between the columns to update their *Stage*
#. Any change of Task Stage here will be common to **all** the assignees of the
   tasks, allowing HR managers to steer their employee's tasks planification,
   but also removing the feature of *Personal Stages*.
#. A manager (like any user) may quickly switch from its own tasks to its department's
   tasks thanks to the native filter *My Department's Tasks* (available when installing
   Odoo CE module `hr_timesheet`)
