This module adds a new type of Budget Lines called *Workforce*.
It largely relies on `hr_department_cost_history` to use the *Hourly Cost*
history as a table of costs per date to value the budget lines.

Link between budget lines and Department or Employee history costs is made
via the analytic account.
