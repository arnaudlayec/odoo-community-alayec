
Date-ranged valuation
---------------------

The principle is to declare hourly or daily cost on product' variants as well as
*Date from* this cost applies. The *Date to* is computed as 1st day before next
product's variant *Date from*. With such date-range price table, the budget lines
are valuated at the prorata as per budget's start and end dates.

#. Activate *Variants* feature of *Inventory* settings
#. Browse to *Inventory / Configuration / Attributes* and create a new attribute,
   like *Year*
#. Activate *Date-ranged values* field. Create values in bottom table, like
   2022, 2023, etc. and fill in start date in *Date* field from which the product
   variants' price with this attribute value will be taken into account

#. Browse to *Inventory / Products / Products* and create a new product with
   *Can be used in budget* box activated
#. To the *Attributes & Variants* table, choose selected attribute and values

#. Browse to *Accounting / Account Move Budget / Product (budget)*
#. You retrieve the created variant and may adjust the value and date
#. When you affect this product on budget line, the date-ranged price table
   of its variants will be used to value the line


Optional Analytic Accounting
-----------------------------

#. Activate *Analytic Accounting* in Global Settings
#. Browse to *Accounting / Configuration / Analytic Accounting* and create a new plan
   and account
#. On the new plan, configure a *Default Product*
#. Back to any budget line, set this *Analytic Account*. The product is pre-filled
   on the budget line, allowing to pre-define budget's lien:
     * unit of measure (useful if days or hours, c.f. previous remark)
     * unit price, for **Unit-price** valuation type
     * date-ranged unit-price, for **Date-range** valuation type
