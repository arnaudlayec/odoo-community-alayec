-----------------------------

#. Activate *Analytic Accounting* in Global Settings
#. Browse to *Accounting / Configuration / Analytic Accounting* and create a new plan
   and account
#. On the new plan, the field *Accountant Only* is activated by default
#. Disable it so that Project Managers can select this type of budgets (i.e. this
   analytic accountant) in project's budget lines



Simplified budget tree view from project
----------------------------------------

A main purpose of this module is allowing Project Manager to view and edit project's
budget. A simplified view of budget is available from Project form button, hiding
accounting fields.

In order this simplified view to make sense (and work), it is recommended:
* for at least the Analytic Account with *Only Accountant* to False...
* ...to have a Template Line rule setting a default General Account from the
  analytic accounts
