No configuration of this module, but *account_move_tier_validation* should
be configured as following so this module makes sense:

#. Browse to *Settings / Technical / Level validation / Level definition*
#. Model: *account.move*
#. Validated by: *Field in the linked record*
#. Reviewer field: *invoice_user_id*
