
Optional configuration
-----------------------

This module creates the sequence *Sales Order (project template)*.
This new sequence is not used by itself but is duplicated per project to provide the
right part of Sales Order's sequence (i.e. "-001" in the example 1234-001).

If needed, you can modify this template sequence from *Global Settings / Technical / Sequences*.
