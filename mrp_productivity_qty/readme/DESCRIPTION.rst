This module allow to manage produced quantities per Work Order instead of
at the Manufacturing Order level, and track progress per performance entry
(timesheet). It enforces this behavior, disabling the standard one for
all Manufacturing Orders.

This can be useful for companies needing to follow the progress of their
workorders in different various units and quantities (e.g. bars, glasses,
cuts, ...) not directly related or in a very business-complex
manner to the MO's final product' manufactured quantity.
