This module allows Managers to create leaves on behalf of the employees they are manager of.
It does not require any configuration or additional rights and is a alternative of granting the
native right *Time Off / Officer: Manage all requests* which grants on-behalf leaves management but
for all employees at once.

This module was designed for companies where some employees cannot request their Time Off by themselves.
