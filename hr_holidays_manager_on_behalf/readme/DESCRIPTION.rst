This module allows Managers to create leaves on behalf of their employees.
It does not require any configuration or additional rights and is a alternative
of granting the native right *Time Off / Officer: Manage all requests* to managers
who needs it.

It can be useful for scenarios where some employees do not have an access to Odoo
Time-Off application.
