This module plugs on *Attendance* app to allow Workers of a manufacturing warehouse to log
productivity entries on Work Orders with the User Experience of *Attendance* app.
Though it is optional, this module is designed to work with a shared account used to log into Odoo from
shared computers in a warehouse, so that Odoo is limited to a Kiosk mode on *Attendance* app and filtered
to *Warehouse Workers*.
Besides this, this module follows same user experience and feature than *Attendance* app (barcode, pin or
manual employee selection) and merges productivity entries to attendance entries allowing to manage Manufacturing
Workers attendance and overtime like with *Attendance* app.
