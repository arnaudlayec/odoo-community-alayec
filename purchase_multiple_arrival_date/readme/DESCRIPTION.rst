This module helps managing multiple arrival dates for Purchase Orders.

Nativally, Odoo already supports arrival date per order lines but it is
not user-friendly to set them for many lines. This module adds a helper
wizard in Purchase Order form to register order acknowledgments files and
confirmed arrival dates, per order lines (all by default).

It also reminds the original requested arrival date of the Purchase Order,
and simplifies the reminder-mail feature by hiding the option per partner
and simply allowing the user to send reminder mail from the Purchase Order.
